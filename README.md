Glass – A poetic or colloquial way to describe the ocean when it’s incredibly calm, smooth, and mirror-like. This app is designed to keep track of weather and ocean conditions, and notify users when the water is "glass"—perfect for diving, snorkeling, or simply enjoying the sea at its most tranquil.
